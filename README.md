# WTF is Gratia.World?

Gratia is an events ticketing platform designed as an experience platform serving creators.

In today's world, fans often miss out on ticket sales when creators launch concerts or events.

We're solving this issue by bringing creators and fans together. Let me explain using a case study.

For example, when a music band launches its world tour, tickets for certain countries often sell out moments after launch. The band might then introduce additional concert dates to accommodate more fans.

However, a recurring problem is that people purchase tickets and resell them on the grey market for 10â€“15 times the original price on platforms like VIAGOGO.

As a result, fans have to pay exorbitant prices, and creators don't receive the true value paid by fans. Gratia offers two types of tickets: flippable and non-flippable. The flippable ticket is an NFT that can be traded and comes with additional utilities, while the non-flippable ticket is a "soul-bound token."

Let me provide another example to illustrate this better. Imagine a concert ticket priced at $100 for a non-flippable ticket. The flippable ticket would come with a slight premium, say $120. If the person who bought the flippable ticket for $120 wants to sell it for $250, the additional $130 would be split three ways: a small percentage goes to the creator, some to the platform, and the majority to the ticket owner.

This solves the initial problem of creators not receiving the full value paid by fans. Additionally, the NFT has an advantage in terms of utilities. This is just one use case for the platform. Beyond this, creators have two options: allow or disallow the sale of non-flippable tickets.

The third issue we're addressing is tickets selling out within moments due to bots or other techniques. We're using blockchain concepts to combat this. One approach is a general access sale, and another involves staking.

For instance, a person can stake an amount for a certain period to support the creator and then get access to tickets.

The third approach is an auction.

The ticket distribution could be customized based on the creator's preference, such as 70% for general sale, 20% for staking rewards, and 10% for auction.

In essence, we're developing a platform to support creators and fans while enhancing the overall experience.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
